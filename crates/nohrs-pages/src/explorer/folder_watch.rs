//! The folder on screen follows the disk: a file another program saves,
//! downloads, deletes or renames there shows up (or goes) without F5.
//!
//! Until 05/11/2026 the listing was read on entering a folder, on F5 and
//! after Prime Files' own operations only, so a file saved by an editor or a
//! browser did not appear — a person who tried it said that alone made them
//! leave the explorer they had used before. Explorer itself watches the
//! folders it shows; so does this, with the system's change notifications
//! (`ReadDirectoryChangesW`, through `notify`), not by polling.
//!
//! Only the folder on screen and the Tree view's open folders are watched,
//! not their subfolders: what is not shown needs no refresh. A save is a
//! burst of events (create, write, rename into place), and a download
//! writes for minutes, so events are gathered for [`SETTLE`] and refreshes
//! kept [`SPACING`] apart; each one is the same refresh as F5, which keeps
//! selection, scroll, open folders and preview.
